Developed by [Florian Eckerstorfer](https://florian.ec) in Vienna, Europe.


Features
--------

Plum is a data processing pipeline, that means it reads data, filters and converts it and then writes the data.

- Filters, converters and even writers are pipeline elements that can be attached to a workflow in arbitrary order
- Readers are iterators that can return values of arbitrary type: arrays, objects or scalars, it doesn't matter to Plum
- Conditional converters that are only applied to an item if it passes a filter
- Ability to concatenate workflow to create smaller and better reusable workflows

*Plum has been greatly inspired by [ddeboer/data-import](https://github.com/ddeboer/data-import).*


Installation
------------

You can install Plum using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```shell
$ composer require cocur/plum:dev-master
```


Usage
-----

Here is a quick preview, but please check out the [documentation](http://plum.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

```php
use Cocur\Plum\Workflow;

$workflow = new Workflow();
$workflow->addFilter($filter)
         ->addConverter($converter)
         ->addWriter($writer);
$workflow->process($reader);
```
